Hello, I’m Forrest!

I'm a web-developer with completed courses (including a professional Udemy JavaScript course) in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I am always building on my knowledge and eager to learn more. <br/>

I am in the process of finishing up my proficiency in vanilla JS, and will soon be taking on React courses and projects!

I am always thinking of ideas for more projects! My focus at this time is a "Global" recipe app, which will allows you to search, filter, and save recipes from all over the world. You can find dishes from countries like Kenya, all the way to Japan, or Canada! I'm working on implementing features such as saving recipes to one's profile and rating recipes based on how much the user enjoyed/disliked the meal! I'm additionally implementing a "profile" system where the user can log in/out and have certain recipes stored. I'm considering a feature for comments as well. <br/>

I just finished a geography-helping web-application called "WorldData". Before that, I completed making a landing page for a mock mobile-banking company, a full, 898-character Pokedex from the Pokemon game series, and finally a Game of Thrones character quiz. <br/><br/>
I am always thinking of new projects and adding to my portfolio! I have some old projects on here too that are minor, but might be fun to look at.
