Hello, I’m Forrest!

I'm an aspiring cybersecurity analyst with experience (including a professional Udemy JavaScript course) in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I am always building on my knowledge and eager to learn more. <br/>

I am currently learning via the Lets Defend SOC Analyst course with plans to get my NET+ and SEC+ through compTIA. I am hoping to land a SOC job over the next year or two. In the meantime, I am building fun apps, learning networking and security vulnerability management, and spending time with my wife and children.

After my certifications, I plan on furthering my education by staying up to date on security issues, and expanding my skill sets to show applicants I am eager to learn and willing to grow and adapt to whatever the role may need!

I like to build fun and unique web applications for my personal use, such as my workout tracker which charts my lifts, exercises and body weight, or my dream logging app "Dreamtime," which allows users to log their dreams along with mood states to chart their moods and dreams!
