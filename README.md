Hello, I’m Forrest!

I'm a web developer with completed courses (including a Udemy JavaScript course) in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I am always building on my knowledge and eager to learn more. <br/><br/>
I am currently working on projects as well. I just finished a website for a mobile banking application mock company, a full, 898 character Pokedex from the Pokemon game series as well as a Game of Thrones character quiz. The Pokedex was my biggest project so far, destructuring json data from an API and building a very large web app with said data. <br/><br/>
I am always thinking of new projects and adding to my portfolio! I have some old projects on here too that are minor, but might be fun to look at.
